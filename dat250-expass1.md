<h1> 1. Installation of the development environment <h1>

  This section was rather smooth. I've opted to install IntelliJ as I have read that it is a user-friendly IDE, and is great for working on small projects. There was no problems 
  with installation.
  
  
 <h2>2. Validating the development kit <h2>
   
   In order to validate it, I simply created a small project, built it and tested the output. Everything worked as it should.
