# Experiment 4 #

## 1. Technical Problems Encountered ##
>The only technical problems encountered was copying/cloning the example "counters" repository. I had an error at the start of "files are outside of the main directory" and after
>realising that all I had to do was add POM.xml to maven, everything seemed to work, except that there were errors in the maven file and the dependencies were not loading in.
>I then read that I could simply open the file from the POM.xml file, and everything worked after that.
