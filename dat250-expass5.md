> ## 1. Technical Problems ##
> There were no significant problems to mention. Only one small nuiance in trying to run a main class method with another in the same package.
> I just commented out the @SpringBootApplication annotation. Then I just realised I can put the other folders as modules in the project folder (done that for ex 3 and 4).
